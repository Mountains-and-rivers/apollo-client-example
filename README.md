# Introduction

This is a quick demo to show how Apollo Client and GraphQL work together.

There's a server and client folder.

To install:

## Server

`yarn install`
`yarn dev`

## Client

`yarn install`
`yarn start`

The server has a json file containing a list of Star Wars character names.

The client will query this. It should all just work.
